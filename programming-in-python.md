# Part 1: Intro to Programming

---

## Automating and Calculating

Programming was invented so humans don't have to do things over and over again

Programming is essentially writing a _set of instructions_ that a computer has to follow

---

## Calculating

Given any two numbers,

1: Add them together
2: Half it
3: If the answer is higher than the first number, say yes
4: Otherwise, say no

---

## In Python Code

```python

    x = 4
    y = 2
    answer = x + y
    halfed_answer = answer / 2
    if halfed_answer > x:
        print "yes"
    else:
        print "no"

```

# Part 2: Storing and using data

---

## Variables

There are different kinds of variables:

-
* _Integers_, which computers can use to do math, e.g. _42_
* _Strings_, which is text that computers can display, e.g. _"hello world"_
-

---

## Variables in Python

```python

    age = 58
    name = "John Cena"
    bio = "My favorite number is 42"

```

---

## Using variables

```python

    bill = 42 + 56
    tip = 5
    total = bill + tip
    note = "Have a nice day!"
    print(total)
    print(note)

```

# Part 3: Decisions

---

## If-Else Decisions

We use calculators to do math.

We use computers to do _so much more_.
